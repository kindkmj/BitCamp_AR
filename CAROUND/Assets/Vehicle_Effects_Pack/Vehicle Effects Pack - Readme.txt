This Vehicle Effects Pack provides a variety of particle effects and props for use in your projects.

For each of the 4 particle effects, simply drag the required effect from the Prefabs folder into the Hierarchy window, dropping it onto the vehicle that requires the effect (making it a child that will move with its parent). You may need to offset the effect prefabs position so that it sits in the correct location (ie so the Car Exhaust Effect comes out of the car tail pipe).

Some of the effects also include sounds; to implement these, simply drag the corresponding audio prefab from the Prefabs folder into the Hierarchy using the same process outlined above.

You may wish to tweak the particle effects to your taste. To do this, simply select your chosen effect in the Hierarchy window, and then alter any of its variables in the Inspector window (on the right). A good place to start would be the Rate (under Emission), Start Size and Start Speed.

You'll also find a collection of objects and textures in the Props folder, again with Prefabs in the same location.

Have fun!
